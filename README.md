# homepage
My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé.
# Homepage project
**Make homepage great!** Make it responsive, accessible, informative, credible, readable, descriptive, compatible, consistent, uncluttered, simple, secure, up-to-date. Alternatively, just give up.
# Resume project
A typical résumé contains a "summary" of relevant job experience and education, as its French origin implies. The résumé is usually one of the first items, along with a cover letter and sometimes an application for employment, which a potential employer sees regarding the job seeker and is typically used to screen applicants. **The goal of this project is to create an online version of the résumé using HTML, CSS, and the minimum amount of JavaScript.**
